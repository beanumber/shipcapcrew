## There Are Two Families of Functions for this Package:

### **1.** Interactive Gameplay
### **2.** Simulation Function

*If you have not done so already, please refer to the ReadME for a description of how to play the game.*

# **Interactively Playing the Game**

This aspect of the package is fairly straight forward. To initiate a single-player game, the only gameplay style for this component, simply use the `start_game()` function. No further arguments are required to start the game, however having your console visable will be helpful. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
start_game()
```

Once the game is initiated, the console will present you with your first set of rolled dice.

You will be made aware of the dice you rolled, the ones that you are allowed to keep, the ones you still need to obtain, and how many rolls you have left in the game. 

You'll then be asked if you would like to reroll and should indicate either:

`Y`, for `yes` you would like to reroll **OR** `N`, for `no` you would not like to reroll

*either way, make sure to capitalize the letter*

If you decide that you would like to reroll, then the number of your remaining dice that were not kept from the previous roll will be rerolled. You'll again be shown they newly rolled nice, told what dice will be kept on your behalf, if any, what dice you still need to collect, and how many rolls you have remaining.

You can continue this process, if you choose, until you have used all three of your rolls. At this point, if you've collected a 6, 5, and 4 (representing a ship, captain, and crew), then your last two remaining dice will be added up to present your final cargo score.

If you are unable to obtain all three required dice, then your score will be zero.

At any point in the game, if you want to opt out of playing, just answer `N` to *Would you like to reroll?* or *Would you like to play again?* You will then be thanked for playing and the function will be halted. Stopping the code chunk the function is in will not terminate the function.

If at any point you would like to play the game again, you should simply rerun the function!
